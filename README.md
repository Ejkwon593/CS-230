CS 230: Operating Platforms - Software Design Document Submission

Summary of The Gaming Room Client and Software Requirements
The Gaming Room is a client that wanted to expand their existing mobile game, Draw It or Lose It, beyond its Android-only platform. The objective was to design a web-based version that supports multiple teams, enhances scalability, and ensures compatibility across various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile devices. The game needed to maintain a seamless user experience while leveraging server-side capabilities for efficient multiplayer management.

What I Did Well in Developing This Documentation
One of the strengths of my documentation was the structured and detailed evaluation of different operating platforms, storage management techniques, and memory optimization strategies. I ensured that every aspect of the design aligned with the client’s requirements while considering future scalability. Additionally, the recommendations were well-researched and practical, addressing both technical constraints and business needs.

Helpful Aspects of Working Through the Design Document
Creating a comprehensive software design document was an essential part of the development process. It helped break down the software’s architecture, ensuring clarity on components such as platform compatibility, storage solutions, and distributed system communication. This structured approach made it easier to visualize the system’s workflow before diving into coding, reducing potential errors and inefficiencies.

Revisions and Improvements
If I could revise one part of my work, I would refine the security section by incorporating more details on best practices for protecting user data, especially regarding encryption and secure authentication methods. Enhancing this section with references to industry standards like OAuth 2.0 and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) would provide additional value to the design.

Interpreting and Implementing User Needs
Understanding user needs was at the forefront of my design approach. By prioritizing cross-platform accessibility, smooth user interaction, and scalability, I ensured that the game would function well for various users. Considering user experience is critical in software design, as it directly impacts engagement, retention, and overall satisfaction.

Approach to Software Design and Future Strategies
I approached the software design process using object-oriented principles and modular development to create a flexible, maintainable architecture. In the future, I would further refine my approach by incorporating agile methodologies, such as iterative prototyping and user feedback loops, to continuously improve the software before deployment. Additionally, using cloud-based microservices could enhance scalability and reduce dependencies on traditional monolithic architectures.
